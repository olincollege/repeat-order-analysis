## Overview

The goal of this project was to understand the quantity and characteristics of
repeat customers of Andrew's Etsy shop, ADesignsDenver. We did this by
connecting to Etsy API to pull all of the order reciepts into a JSON. Then we
processed the data to find key metrics such as repeat order rate, the sizes
of those orders, orders broken down by state, and time between repeat orders.
Finally we visualized the data using matplotlib.
